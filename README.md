# Majifix

MajiFix was developed by the World Bank in Tanzania to solve the challenge of tracking problems in cities through citizen crowd sourcing.

MajiFix builds up on the movement of civic issue tracking by adopting since day zero the well known standard Open311 GeoReport v2.

MajiFix is completely open source. It is free to use and to adapt, or adopt by anyone.

This is an official documentation on how you can contribute, use , extend or deploy
MajiFix to your organization.
