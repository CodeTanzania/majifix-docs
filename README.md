# Majifix

MajiFix was developed by the World Bank in Tanzania to solve the challenge of tracking problems in cities through citizen crowd sourcing.

MajiFix builds up on the movement of civic issue tracking by adopting since day zero the well known standard Open311 GeoReport v2.

MajiFix is completely open source. It is free to use and to adapt, or adopt by anyone.

## Our aim

With MajiFix, we aim to:

Open city governments, by creating new communication channels with their citizens.
allow citizens to report problems they face in their daily lives, and empowering them to share existing problems.
support public service providers in solving each and every problem, while giving feedback to people about updates on the efforts to solve each problem.

## Majifix components

MajiFix has different components

- A ticket management system to support public officials to keep track of problems that were reported.
- A management app that provides statistics about system performance to city managers.
- A mobile app that citizens can use to easily report problems.
- A Facebook Messenger Bot, so that people can submit problems through FB Messengerâ€™s interface. No need to download an app.
- A USSD interface, specially relevant in places where not everyone owns a smartphone.
- A public website, that publicly shows what is going on with the system.

## Our vision

MajiFix tries to achieve two main outcomes:

- Improving efficiency of public services, by providing relevant information to the relevant stakeholders,at the right time.
- Improving social accountability about public services, by providing public statistics about the performance of public services.
