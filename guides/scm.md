For this project we are using git as our **Version Control System**.

## Git Flow

## Commit Message Best Practices

- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

### Examples

- If applied, this commit will ***refactor subsystem X for readability***
- If applied, this commit will ***update getting started documentation***
- If applied, this commit will ***remove deprecated methods***
- If applied, this commit will ***release version 1.0.0***
- If applied, this commit will ***merge pull request #123 from user/branch***

From the above examples the phase in **bold** and *italic* font should be used as the subject in your commit. Remember to observe all the above mentioned commit message best practices.
