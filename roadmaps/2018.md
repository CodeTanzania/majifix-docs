# Majifix Roadmap 2018

This page outlines work that is currently being worked on and things we plan to work on next, within this year of 2018. That said, we do value feedback from the community to help us better understand user needs and adjust priorities.

## Majifix API

Majifix API is built on Node.JS. It is a RESTful API layer designed in support of reporting and tracking common public-service (i.e. water) problems.

It is consists of a suite of node packages covering the business/domain logic (the part of a platform that encodes the real-world business rules that determine how data is created, displayed, stored and changed), built for performance and scale.

It has full support for searching, filtering, limiting, sorting, offsetting, input validation and data aggregation (through MongoDB's aggregation pipeline).

You can consider it as the data layer within a platform (including the data model). It is designed to be plugged into a templating layer, a mobile application or to be used with any other data consumer.

Majifix API provides a starting point that's further advanced than a framework. It allows you to get a complete data layer up and running in minutes.
