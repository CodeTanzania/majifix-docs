# MajiFix Roadmap for 2018

The 2017 year came to a graceful end. It is now time to assess how far along we have come, to plan and refurnish our strategy for the future, 2018.

This page outlines work that is currently being worked on and things we plan to work on next, within the year of 2018. When planning, we look at potential work from three perspectives:

- __Citizen:__ The MajiFix project emphasizes on solving challenges to better lives of all civilians in Tanzania. MajiFix is already doing this, and wants to do more.
- __Core:__ The underlying methodical secrets of MajiFix are composed with great care, out in the open and grouped into this layer. We want to provide a better experience, out of the box, to make development and deployment faster.
- __Back office or CRM:__ MajiFix functions depend on crowd-source data. The accumulated data is nicely packaged for all managers to see and analyze. We plan to improve the analytics to further help managers make more informed decisions.

That said, we do value feedback from the community to help us better understand user needs and adjust priorities.

## MajiFix Core

We want all Citizen extensions to have a smooth and consistent experience so that all citizens are feel compelled to report as many issues as they possibly can. We have continously achieved this goal thanks to the mass efforts put into the core layer. We understand that we need to challenge the status quo and do more.

## MajiFix CRM (Customer Relationship Management)

The primary role of the MajiFix CRM is to analyze citizen data collected through multiple Citizen channels, and present it so that managers can make more informed decisions. We further plan to use techniques such as data mining, correlation, and pattern recognition to analyze the customer data.
